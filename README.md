## 💼 Project Context
This project was developed as a professional technical collaboration to support Master-level research in Applied Physics. The objective was to build a reliable automated system to analyze MRI raw data and calculate the relaxivity of specific contrast agents based on experimental parameters.

## 🎯 Technical Scope
The system processes MRI signal data to extract physical properties critical for medical research, bridging the gap between complex MRI physics and data engineering.

### **Core Engineering Tasks:**
* **Signal Decay Modeling**: Implementing non-linear least squares fitting to solve for $T_1$ and $T_2$ times using the Bloch equations framework.
* **Automated Data Parsing**: Developing a workflow to extract Echo Times (TE) and pixel intensity values directly from DICOM medical imaging headers.
* **Statistical Validation**: Calculating $R^2$ values and error estimations to ensure the accuracy of the mathematical fitting against ground truth values.

## 📊 Methodology & Visuals
The scripts take raw MRI sequences and generate precise relaxation curves to determine how contrast agents affect signal intensity over time.
